    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Galangal</b>: The ‘kha’ in Tom Kha Gai translates to galangal, which really is the foundation of this coconut soup. Commonly mistaken for ginger, galangal is a rhizome (like ginger) but they are two entirely different plants. Galangal is a bit more peppery and earthy compared with ginger. </li>
        <li><b>Coconut milk</b>: The creamy nature of this soup is all from the coconut milk. It’s important to use a full-fat coconut milk for this recipe to get the most out of its flavor. Pro tip: Look at the ingredient list of your coconut milk and make sure that coconut is listed as the first ingredient, not coconut extracts. </li>
        <li><b>Lemongrass</b>: Incredibly aromatic lemongrass imparts a zesty, citrusy, and earthy flavor to the broth. </li>
        <li><b>Makrut lime leaves</b>: Used similarly to bay and curry leaves, makrut lime leaves add a bold, citrusy flavor with subtle floral notes to the broth.</li>
        <li><b>Fish sauce</b>: In lieu of table salt, the broth gets its strong savory-salty flavor from a hefty dose of fish sauce. I personally use Thai-style Squid brand because it’s harvested much more potent than other varieties, but lighter versions (like Vietnamese fish sauce) also work great. </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Cook the chicken in chicken broth and coconut milk.</b> Pour the chicken broth and coconut milk to a large saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until the chicken is fork-tender. </li>
        <li><b>Add the aromatics.</b> Lemongrass, galangal, makrut lime leaves give the broth its savory-complex flavor. Smash the lemongrass and galangal a bit before adding to get the most out of its flavor. Let them cook in the broth for at least 10 minutes so the broth can absorb all its flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Season with aromatics and cook the mushrooms until tender.</b> Add mushrooms, fish sauce, and sugar and cook mushrooms until they soften, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li><b>Season with lime juice and bird’s eye chilies and serve.</b> Add the lime juice, bird’s eye chilies and mix until combined. Garnish with cilantro and scallions if desired. </li>
    </ol>
